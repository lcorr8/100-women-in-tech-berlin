# 100-women-in-tech-berlin

Personal project to meet and speak to 100 women in Berlin about their experience in Tech in 2024. This project came about when I met Xiaomei, after a CodePub event at Taxfix. We realized we had a lot of shared interest, as well as overlapping goals for the year. Over the course of coffee, we brainedstormed ways in which we could work on our shared goals together. 

The goals were:
- meet more women in tech, because we were feeling isolated at work and were looking to create community
- foster visibility of women in tech for the next generation
- work on our public speaking skills
- work on feeling more comfortable in front of a camera
